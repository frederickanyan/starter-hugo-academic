# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My substantive areas of interests are stress, resilience and mental health, including processes leading to positive adaptation and outcomes for mental health, the competence of at risk and vulnerable populations, particularly risk and protective factors in children, adolescents and families, loneliness and social isolation, and the psychosocial determinants of youth and adult mental health. My current quantitative and research method works cover a broad range of topics in design and data analysis, using complex methodology from both structural equations and multilevel modelling perspectives, and the application of general and advanced quantitative methods, psychometrics, and psychological network analysis. I try to combine these quantitative and substantive interests into a single program of research that seeks to understand and promote human adaptation and resilience for intervention science, practice, and policy.

Frederick Anyan is a Researcher at the Department of Psychology in NTNU. Frederick leads the Resilience to loneliness (RESLON) Lab, investigating the complex interplay between biological systems with psychological and social-environmental factors in loneliness for mental and physical health outcomes. The RESLON-MPH Lab uses various research approaches combining intensive longitudinal data (e.g., experienced sampling methods), large-scale genetic studies (e.g., genemoe-wide asociation studies (GWAS) to identify network of genes), and intranasal oxytocin trials.

Frederick is the Principal Investigator of the RESLON project and the longitudinal analyses of mental health, vulnerability, and protective factors among Norwegian Afghanistan veterans deployed to Afghanistan between 2001 to 2020.
